Install and setup instructions:
1) Download and save all matlab script files (.m) into one folder.
2) Start Matlab (script has been ran/tested on version r2014a - r2018b)
3) Run: pathtool
4) Select: add with subfolders
5) In the browser select the folder you defined in step 1.
6) Select: Save
7) Select: Close

You should now have all script in the path. Meaning that you can type: bcj_
and press 'Tab'. There should now appear a list of functions/scripts
(eg. bcj_XPSCParam, bcj_wranglAxgx) that you can run.

Source data:
The source dataset was saved as a .mat file containing metadata and data in a
nested-matlab structure called dfEla. All metadata was manually input in this
dataset.
Due to the size of this file, the file is not included in the repository, essentially
rawdataset.csv is the same without the raw traces and nested metadata.

Structure contains the following columns:
{'cellID'          }
{'animalID'        }
{'genoType'        }
{'cellType'        }
{'recordLayer'     }
{'recordRegion'    }
{'stimSource'      }
{'stimChannel'     }
{'conditionName'   }
{'signal'          }
{'samplerate'      }
{'averageTrace'    }
{'allTraces'       }
{'onset'           }
{'risetime'        }
{'slope'           }
{'amplitude'       }
{'onset2peakTime'  }
{'halfwidth'       }
{'decay'           }
{'slope2ms'        }
{'slope3ms'        }
{'area'            }
{'test1DrugName'   }
{'waveformSequence'}
{'meta'            }
{'stimOnset'       }

The dataset is subsequently saved as an .csv (excluding the nested data columns:
averageTrace, allTraces, and meta).
This dataset is called "rawdataset.csv" and is included in this repository.

Functions:
Main users function/scripts are:
bcj_XPSCParam: used to extract waveform/trace parameters such as onset,
    amplitude etc.
bcj_wranglAxgx: used to extract waveforms/traces and affiliated metadata from
    axgx files (axograph X software) and csv (user-annotated metadata).

Helper functions:
bcj_slidingPeak.m: used calculate the peak amplitude based on a smoothened
    waveform/trace (smoothened using a x ms window to average the data).
importaxo: used to import axgx files. Script is work from MJ Russo and
    others.
movingmean: used to smoothen the waveform/trace. Script is work from Glen
    Mackey.


Pipeline:
Two experimenters had different hardware and software setups, see manuscript
Birdsong, Jongbloets et al. eLife 2019.

Bart C Jongbloets:
Raw waveform traces obtained from whole-cell/cell-attached patch-clamp
recordings using ephus (http://scanimage.vidriotechnologies.com/display/ephus/Ephus).
Dataformat of ephus: .xsg.

Metadata was annotated in a nested matlab structure format (dfEla) and
parameters of the waveform traces, after averaging per condition, were extracted
using bcj_XPSCParam function in Matlab.
see section 'Source data' for comments on dataformat and structure.

Exceptions are:
1) cell-attached data (Figure 6), data: 'dataStrucSpike.mat'
2) rebuttal experiments, data: 'data_rebuttal_experiments.mat'
    analysis: 'analyze_rebuttal_experiments.m'


William T Birdsong:
Raw waveform traces were obtained from whole-cell patch-clamp recordings using
Axograph X (https://axograph.com/download/axograph). Condition-based averages
were generated and saved for analysis.
Dataformat of the averaged waveform traces: .axgx.

Metadata was user-annotated in a .csv spreadsheet using the template:
axgx_metadata_template.xlsx (see repository). Subsequently, bcj_wranglAxgx
function in matlab was used to extract averaged waveform traces and metadata
from the axgx and corresponding csv files. Data was saved and appended to
the nested matlab structure format used by Bart C Jongbloets (dfEla).

The nested matlab structure dfEla was then saved as .csv, after removal of the
nested data. This dataset ('rawdataset.csv') was used for analysis in R.
